RifTop
======


Base code working from my work towards the oculus rift gamejam. I plan to use this as a starting point to develop an oculus compatble window manager for windows to streamline the development process so that work can be done with both the rift on or off depending on style.

Todo list in no particular order.
Convert to using relative paths to make building easier
Add build instructions
Standardise class field and method naming.
Convert to using IOC
Add Unit test assembly
Create window manager controlling windows window handles
Populate billboards with window textures
Local only input and window movement
Pump messages back to active window
Detect newly opened windows.

In Progress
Bring system windows in as textures.
